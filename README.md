# TennisKata
For an interview, I've been asked to do this kata...

## Little background on language selection
I've hesitated quite some time on the correct language. I'm more fluent on Java, so it should have been an obvious choice...
I also wanted to do in Python (because Python is cool) or, more weirdly, in arduino. But it would have been quite a stretch to implement all this. And the use was quite limited, unless I wanted to implement an arduino Tennis Game.

So Java it is

## Implementations
I Implemented this in around 3 hours, including the thinking process and the selection of the playlist (which was clearly not the best one #CCommeCorneilleCCommeClasseToiMemeTuSais).
I chose to use an enum for the points counting, with some functions to navigate through the points (mostly around advantage and deuce).

The points are "personnal" to a player, which has a name and their current Point.

Finally, the Game contains the players.

## Evolutions
One version that I would love to implement is a three-way tennis with a triangular court. I think this has been made as a joke somewhere on the internet. I have no idea how this would go in real life...
